Foundation of Machine Learning Project Guidelines

DONE:
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, duplicate data, and outliers.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
Encode categorical variables (if any).
Feature scaling (if required).
Perform feature transformation if necessary.
Model Selection & Training:
Identify important features.
Feature Selection & Engineering:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Tune hyperparameters to improve results.
Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, etc.).




Train at least two different models and compare their performance.
Model Evaluation:
Justify the selection of evaluation metrics.
Insights & Conclusion:
Interpret the results and provide real-world insights.
Suggest improvements or future scope.



TODO: 
- Clearly mention the dataset source and its description in your report.
- Justify the choice of the target variable in your report.

Each group must submit:
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with proper markdown explanations.
PowerPoint Presentation (.pptx) for evaluation.
On the submission deadline, each group will present their project in front of the class.
Ensure all group members are prepared for the presentation and Q&A session.
