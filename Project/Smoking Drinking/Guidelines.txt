Foundation of Machine Learning Project Guidelines

DONE:
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, duplicate data, and outliers.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
Encode categorical variables (if any).
Feature scaling (if required).
Perform feature transformation if necessary.
Model Selection & Training:
Identify important features.
Feature Selection & Engineering:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.




Train at least two different models and compare their performance.
Tune hyperparameters to improve results.
Model Evaluation:
Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, etc.).
Justify the selection of evaluation metrics.
Insights & Conclusion:
Interpret the results and provide real-world insights.
Suggest improvements or future scope.



TODO: 
- Clearly mention the dataset source and its description in your report.
- Justify the choice of the target variable in your report.

6. Evaluation, Submission & Presentation

This project will be considered as CA3.
Submission and presentation dates:
Group 1: 21st April 2025
Group 2: 22nd April 2025
Each group must submit:
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with proper markdown explanations.
PowerPoint Presentation (.pptx) for evaluation.
On the submission deadline, each group will present their project in front of the class.
Ensure all group members are prepared for the presentation and Q&A session.
